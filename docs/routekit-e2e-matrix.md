# RouteKit end-to-end verification matrix

Run the credential-free matrix:

```bash
pnpm test:e2e:matrix
```

It exercises the five launch provider classes (`openai`, `anthropic`,
`openrouter`, `codex`, and `claude-code`) through the OpenAI Chat, Anthropic
Messages, and Responses HTTP boundaries. It also launches every installed
coding-agent CLI through the real
`routekit` command in a tmux PTY. Each CLI case selects a non-default
namespaced model, types a deterministic prompt, waits for a response, and
checks the model that reached the gateway. Claude Code and Codex additionally
execute a simulator-scripted safe shell tool call. The existing subscription
pool suite covers eligible-account selection, proactive quota switching,
quota failover, transient throttling, and all-members-unavailable exhaustion.
The `native-pickers` case also verifies that Claude Code sees `claude-code/*`
as bare Claude names, Codex sees `codex/*` as bare Codex names, duplicate
namespaced entries are absent from those pickers, and the global OpenAI catalog
remains namespaced.

The deterministic `anthropic-thinking` case routes both buffered and
pathologically chunked streaming Messages requests through the canonical
`claude-code` provider backend. It asserts exact adaptive controls, signed
assistant-history replay, `signature_delta`, `redacted_thinking`, and separation
of thinking from answer text.

The deterministic `dynamic-reasoning-capabilities` case verifies that ordered
opaque effort IDs and config provenance survive model discovery, that a
supported value reaches OpenRouter egress, and that an unavailable value is
rejected with `400` before provider transport.

Transactional account activation has a separate process-interruption record:
[RouteKit transactional account activation evidence](routekit-account-activation-evidence.md).
It covers an actual child `SIGKILL`, daemon startup recovery, injected
connector failure, idempotent replay, and transaction-journal redaction without
copying provider credentials into artifacts.

Per-request routing and billing inspection has a separate protocol and privacy
record: [RouteKit request attribution evidence](routekit-request-attribution-evidence.md).
It covers model-call correlation, effective/native model identity, provider and
billing mode, subscription-seat attempts and failover, usage/cost state,
bounded retention, human/JSON CLI output, and automated secret redaction.

## Live real-account mode

Live calls are disabled unless explicitly authorized:

```bash
ROUTEKIT_LIVE_E2E=1 pnpm test:e2e:matrix
```

Live mode first reruns the deterministic matrix, then starts RouteKit with
`.routekit/router.yaml`. Failure to discover any configured provider is a
failure. An installed CLI that cannot complete is also a failure; a missing
optional CLI is an explicit skip. Prompts and HTTP output limits are kept
small. The default hard limit is 48 client-to-RouteKit model requests,
including extra agent turns such as a tool result or OpenCode title generation.
This is not an invoice or provider-egress counter: a provider backend can make
bounded internal retries or same-kind subscription rotations after one gateway
request. Authorize provider-account spend separately under the route's
documented retry policy.

Live mode repeats the native-picker assertions for configured Claude Code and
Codex providers. Catalog checks do not issue model-generation requests and
therefore add zero live model requests.

Before generation cases, live mode also runs
`routekit --json models info <provider/model>` for one discovered model from
every configured provider. It writes the secret-free contract fields to
`live-route-info.json`, verifies the native model and provider, and rejects any
configured credential value in command output. This route-explanation check
starts an isolated singleton daemon and adds zero model-generation calls.

When `claude-code` and the `pool` door are selected, live mode also loads the
real enrolled account set, injects a quota response for the first selected
member, and asserts that the second member succeeds and becomes active. The
fault and success response are local, so this failover case consumes no model
quota and writes cooldown state only under the temporary matrix directory.

Useful filters:

```bash
pnpm test:e2e:matrix -- --provider openrouter,codex
pnpm test:e2e:matrix -- --door openai-chat,claude
ROUTEKIT_LIVE_E2E=1 pnpm test:e2e:matrix -- \
  --provider claude-code --door pool --max-live-calls 1
ROUTEKIT_LIVE_E2E=1 pnpm test:e2e:matrix -- \
  --model openrouter=openrouter/openai/gpt-4.1-nano \
  --timeout-ms 180000 --max-live-calls 20
```

The equivalent environment filters are `ROUTEKIT_E2E_PROVIDER`,
`ROUTEKIT_E2E_DOOR`, `ROUTEKIT_E2E_TIMEOUT_MS`, and
`ROUTEKIT_E2E_MAX_LIVE_CALLS`.

## L06 real-account qualification

ENG-679 qualifies the seven first-launch routes by their stable L05 anchors:

```bash
ROUTEKIT_LIVE_E2E=1 pnpm test:e2e:matrix -- \
  --route route-openai-api,route-anthropic-api,route-openrouter-api,\
route-codex-subscription,route-claude-code-subscription,\
route-cursor-ide,route-cursor-agent \
  --max-live-calls 32
```

`--route` cannot be combined with the lower-level `--provider` or `--door`
filters. Prefer one route per invocation while diagnosing a failure. This keeps
credential discovery and live traffic attributable:

```bash
ROUTEKIT_LIVE_E2E=1 pnpm test:e2e:matrix -- \
  --route route-openai-api --max-live-calls 1
```

The qualification descriptors live in
[`scripts/routekit-qualification.mjs`](../scripts/routekit-qualification.mjs).
They intentionally omit Google, Gemini, Grok, Kimi, CLIProxy, OpenCode, MLX,
and every other Not offered route. The live router config is generated in the
matrix temporary directory; qualification does not edit the committed
`.routekit/router.yaml` or import it into the daemon.

### Preflight and account modes

Check availability without printing a credential or account identifier:

```bash
for name in OPENAI_API_KEY ANTHROPIC_API_KEY OPENROUTER_API_KEY; do
  test -n "${!name:-}" && echo "$name=set" || echo "$name=unset"
done
command -v claude codex cursor-agent
```

- OpenAI, Anthropic, and OpenRouter use their named environment variables.
- Codex and Claude Code require enrolled RouteKit subscription accounts and
  their corresponding official client versions.
- `cursor-agent` requires an authenticated client plus the selected RouteKit
  provider route.
- Cursor IDE requires an authenticated desktop client on a host supported by
  Cursorkit's `ck` launcher. A headless or unsupported host is a **Fail**, not
  a Skip.

Never echo token values, inspect credential JSON, or copy account filenames
into evidence. A missing key, client, login, account, or supported desktop is a
route-level Fail with a fixed reason code.

### Request and spend controls

Every route reserves a conservative gateway-request maximum before live execution. The matrix
refuses to start if the selected routes cannot fit within
`--max-live-calls`; the local counting proxy enforces the same cap at request
time. API and subscription HTTP routes reserve one gateway request each.
`cursor-agent` reserves two because a tool turn may require a continuation.
The Cursor IDE descriptor reserves one request, but this Linux runner records
that route as Fail without issuing it.

The cap does not observe provider-internal retries and must not be represented
as a provider-request or billing limit. API routes have no RouteKit retry or
fallback. Subscription retries and same-kind rotation remain bounded by the
route contract; run those routes individually with an account-level spend
authorization.

Deterministic checks run before live traffic and prove:

- streaming, tool-call, and reasoning transport for each selected protocol;
- client cancellation propagates to the upstream response body;
- a selected provider failure reaches the caller and makes zero calls to every
  other configured provider.

These checks establish RouteKit behavior without intentionally causing a paid
provider failure. Live mode then proves the real credential/account and model
path with a small streamed response. OpenRouter's provider-managed upstream
routing remains distinct from RouteKit fallback.

### Cursor IDE evidence and restore

Run the active RouteKit wrapper on a supported, logged-in desktop host against
the same RouteKit revision. It launches the bundled Cursorkit
`desktop-ui-experimental` suite itself through a local counting proxy. The
wrapper requires the exact desktop result to pass, queries `cursor --version`,
and measures the namespaced model and client-to-gateway request count. The
Cursor route permits exactly one model call; zero calls or a second attempted
call fail and the proxy refuses the second call.

Cancellation, failure propagation, and no RouteKit fallback come from the
named passing deterministic matrix cases embedded in the attestation, not from
the desktop harness. Setup requires Cursorkit to report that its isolated local
model profile was seeded. Restore requires the wrapper's allowlisted
default-profile count/digest to be identical before and after process cleanup
and requires removal of the temporary isolated profile. No Pass dimension is
inferred from an unrelated harness result.

Raw Cursorkit logs, CDP reports, prompts, responses, profile paths, and bridge
transcripts remain local, nondurable diagnostics. Do not copy them into this
repository. The wrapper stores only a digest of its temporary `summary.json`,
aggregate state counts/digests, linked matrix case IDs, and allowlisted
outcomes.

Self-authored JSON is not a trust boundary. The L06 generator rejects legacy or
free-form manual records and re-derives schema-2 reviewed records from the bound
matrix and optional RouteKit-owned Cursor attestation before applying them.

For Codex and Claude Code, the live runner copies only the selected enrolled
credential files into its mode-`0600` temporary RouteKit home, verifies the
source account store is unchanged after shutdown, and removes the temporary
home. For `cursor-agent`, the runner copies only the allowlisted Cursor CLI
auth/config state into a private `CURSOR_CONFIG_DIR`, hashes the allowlisted
source bytes before and after the isolated live launch, and emits only
setup/restore pass/fail. File names, contents, and individual digests are never
serialized. A response alone does not prove setup/restore; every required setup
and restore outcome must pass. API-key routes correctly mark setup/restore as
not applicable.

## Artifacts and interpretation

Each run writes a timestamped `report.json` and sanitized PTY transcripts under
`.artifacts/routekit-e2e/`. This directory is ignored by Git. The report has
exact case and route pass/fail/skip counts, top-level failure count, per-case
duration and gateway-request counts, and the total number of client-to-RouteKit
model requests observed at the local counting proxy. Every result has a stable
`caseId` and the applicable L05 `routeIds`; cases for not-offered doors such as
OpenCode deliberately have an empty `routeIds` list.
Schema version 4 also records the exact Git SHA, RouteKit and client versions,
authorized budget, selected route anchors, fixed reason codes, route
capabilities, billing basis, setup/restore outcomes, evidence-map digest, exact
source revision and dirty state, and completeness.
PTY cases isolate RouteKit and XDG runtime state and disable CLI auto-updaters
so test runs cannot rewrite user-level executable links.

- `pass`: the boundary or real CLI completed and routed the requested model.
- `fail`: a configured provider, installed door, response, model-selection, or
  safe-tool assertion regressed.
- `skip`: an optional CLI binary was not installed, with the reason recorded.

Provider credentials are never copied into artifacts. Review the report before
using a wider filter or increasing the call budget. `.artifacts` is diagnostic
and must not be linked as durable L06 evidence. Publish only an allowlisted,
reviewed report under `docs/evidence/`; never commit PTY transcripts, prompts,
responses, authorization headers, account identifiers, or local paths.

### Reviewed manual-evidence workflow

Start from a clean tree and preserve the tested revision:

```bash
test -z "$(git status --porcelain)"
REVISION="$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
ROUTEKIT_LIVE_E2E=1 pnpm test:e2e:matrix -- \
  --route route-openai-api,route-anthropic-api,route-openrouter-api,\
route-codex-subscription,route-claude-code-subscription,\
route-cursor-ide,route-cursor-agent \
  --max-live-calls 32
```

The matrix command is expected to exit nonzero while the four route summaries
remain gated by `manual-evidence-unavailable`. Use the printed schema-4
`REPORT` path; do not edit it. Codex, Claude Code, and `cursor-agent` reviewed
records are derived from their qualification rows and all mapped/supporting
case results—there are no operator-authored summaries.

On the desktop host, start an isolated RouteKit gateway for `$REVISION` on the
attestation-only loopback address `http://127.0.0.1:43123`. The wrapper rejects
non-loopback or alternate destinations. Supply its data-plane bearer only
through `ROUTEKIT_CURSOR_GATEWAY_TOKEN`; the wrapper replaces the child
harness's local placeholder authorization at its proxy and never prints,
writes, or passes the real token to Cursorkit:

```bash
read -rsp "RouteKit gateway token: " ROUTEKIT_CURSOR_GATEWAY_TOKEN
echo
export ROUTEKIT_CURSOR_GATEWAY_TOKEN
node scripts/generate-routekit-cursor-attestation.mjs \
  --matrix-report .artifacts/routekit-e2e/<run>/report.json \
  --revision "$REVISION" \
  --timeout-ms 180000 \
  --output .artifacts/routekit-e2e/<run>/cursor-ide-attestation.json
unset ROUTEKIT_CURSOR_GATEWAY_TOKEN
```

This command fails if the desktop result is absent, skipped, failed, missing
required machine observations, the default profile changes, the isolated
profile cannot be removed, the exact model is not observed once, the one-call
budget is exceeded, a child exits unsuccessfully, or `cursor --version` is
unavailable. It terminates only the exact child/process-group IDs recorded
under its private temporary root and never uses process-name cleanup. Raw
Cursorkit artifacts are deleted after the allowlisted summary is consumed; the
command never prints artifact contents.

Generate the reviewed records. Omit `--cursor-attestation` only when generating
the three non-IDE records; that omission cannot qualify Cursor IDE:

```bash
node scripts/generate-routekit-manual-records.mjs \
  --matrix-report .artifacts/routekit-e2e/<run>/report.json \
  --cursor-attestation .artifacts/routekit-e2e/<run>/cursor-ide-attestation.json \
  --revision "$REVISION" \
  --output .artifacts/routekit-e2e/<run>/reviewed-manual-records.json
```

Finally, promote the exact matrix and generated records:

```bash
node scripts/generate-routekit-l06-evidence.mjs \
  --matrix-report .artifacts/routekit-e2e/<run>/report.json \
  --revision "$REVISION" \
  --manual-records .artifacts/routekit-e2e/<run>/reviewed-manual-records.json
```

The command rejects dirty, incomplete, stale-mapping, count-inconsistent, or
identity-forged reports, credential-shaped content, zero/over-budget
observations, unavailable versions, failed protocol/behavior/setup/restore,
and records that are not the exact trusted projection. It then regenerates
`docs/routekit-l06-evidence.{json,md}`. Cases absent from a filtered run and
manual records not supplied with that promotion revert to `pending`; prior
passes and revision-specific client, provider, and credential metadata are
never carried to a new revision. Manual-record files must name the same full
`testedRevision`, matrix digest, and evidence-map digest. CI reruns the
generator with `--check`, so a mapping change or hand-edited durable report
fails closed. Promotion never changes a row to `qualified` unless every mapped
machine case, exact version, bounded gateway observation, protocol/behavior
outcome, and setup/restore check passes.
