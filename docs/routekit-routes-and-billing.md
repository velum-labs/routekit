# RouteKit routes, billing, and provider disclosures

Audience: maintainers reviewing RouteKit's launch support contract. The
user-facing source of truth is
[`/docs/reference/routes-and-billing`](../apps/docs/content/docs/reference/routes-and-billing.mdx).
Keep this mirror aligned when route behavior or qualification evidence changes.

All seven routes remain **Planned Supported until L06 closes**. The 2026-07-22
[real-account report](evidence/routekit-real-account/2026-07-22-dad16c53.md)
records three API-route Pass results and four subscription/client Fail results
at `@velum-labs/routekit` 0.8.0 revision
[`dad16c53`](https://github.com/velum-labs/routekit/commit/dad16c53c0e083a51d41df59149a21964d27cc12).
The Fail rows must be rerun with the required accounts and clients before the
public labels can change.

## Shared contract

- A requested namespaced model never falls through to another provider.
  Unknown routes fail; an explicit `defaultModel` applies only when a client
  omits the model.
- API routes have no RouteKit account-pool or cross-provider failover.
- Subscription pools rotate only among eligible accounts of the same kind.
  Exhaustion never switches to an API-key provider.
- FusionKit's separately configured `onRateLimit: fusion` panel expansion is
  not a RouteKit route fallback.
- RouteKit never claims unlimited use. Provider terms, plan limits, fair-use
  controls, quotas, and model availability always apply.

## OpenAI API

- **Credential / owner:** User-owned `OPENAI_API_KEY`; optional explicit
  `OPENAI_BASE_URL`. Inline router-YAML keys are rejected.
- **Billing / egress:** API-key route, separate from the Codex subscription
  route, direct to `api.openai.com` unless the operator overrides the
  destination. OpenAI determines charges; exact attribution remains an L06
  check. No aggregator.
- **Quota / fallback:** Provider errors return to the caller; no account pool
  and no silent cross-provider fallback.
- **Protocol / limitations:** OpenAI Chat Completions, streaming, and tools;
  model-specific reasoning and images depend on OpenAI. No provider-session
  restore.
- **Evidence:** **L06 qualification Pass** for `openai/gpt-5.5`, RouteKit 0.8.0
  / `dad16c53` / 2026-07-22. One real-account request was observed; tools,
  streaming, reasoning, cancellation, failure propagation, and no RouteKit
  fallback passed. Public status stays Planned until L06 closes. [Stable L05 mapping; canonical import pending
  evidence](routekit-l06-evidence.md#route-openai-api).

<a id="route-anthropic-api"></a>

## Anthropic API

- **Credential / owner:** User-owned `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; optional explicit
  `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`. RouteKit does not currently use
  `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` for provider requests.
- **Billing / egress:** API-key route, separate from the Claude Code
  subscription route, direct to `api.anthropic.com` by default. Anthropic
  determines charges; exact attribution remains an L06 check. No aggregator.
- **Quota / fallback:** Provider errors return to the caller; no account pool
  and no silent cross-provider fallback.
- **Protocol / limitations:** Native Messages with streaming, tools, thinking,
  signatures, and redacted-thinking where supported. Cross-dialect translation
  can preserve only shared fields. No provider-session restore.
- **Evidence:** **L06 qualification Pass** for
  `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6`, RouteKit 0.8.0 / `dad16c53` / 2026-07-22.
  One real-account request was observed; tools, streaming, reasoning,
  cancellation, failure propagation, and no RouteKit fallback passed. Public
  status stays Planned until L06 closes. [Stable L05 mapping; canonical import pending
  evidence](routekit-l06-evidence.md#route-anthropic-api).

<a id="route-openrouter-api"></a>

## OpenRouter API

- **Credential / owner:** User-owned `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.
- **Billing / egress:** OpenRouter API-key/credit route, not a native
  subscription route. OpenRouter determines charges and credit usage; exact
  attribution remains an L06 check. **OpenRouter is an aggregator:** RouteKit
  sends request content to `openrouter.ai`, which sends it to an upstream
  provider under OpenRouter routing. A model slug does not guarantee one
  upstream host. RouteKit supplies attribution headers.
- **Quota / fallback:** No RouteKit account pool or silent direct-provider
  switch. OpenRouter's own upstream routing remains governed by the user's
  OpenRouter settings and terms.
- **Protocol / limitations:** OpenAI Chat Completions; tools, streaming, images,
  context, and reasoning depend on OpenRouter and the upstream model. No
  provider-session restore.
- **Evidence:** **L06 qualification Pass** for
  `openrouter/openai/gpt-4o-mini`, RouteKit 0.8.0 / `dad16c53` / 2026-07-22.
  One real-account request was observed; tools, streaming, reasoning,
  cancellation, failure propagation, and no RouteKit fallback passed.
  OpenRouter remains the upstream-routing aggregator. Public status stays
  Planned until L06 closes. [Stable L05 mapping; canonical import pending
  evidence](routekit-l06-evidence.md#route-openrouter-api).

<a id="route-codex-subscription"></a>

## Codex subscription

- **Credential / owner:** User-owned Codex OAuth credential enrolled with
  `accounts login codex` or imported with `accounts add`; stored under
  `~/.routekit/subscriptions/codex/`.
- **Billing / egress:** Uses the enrolled subscription OAuth credential, never
  `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and relays directly to `chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex`.
  The provider determines plan usage and charges; exact attribution remains an
  L06 check. No third-party aggregator.
- **Quota / fallback:** Quota can rotate eligible Codex accounts. Transient
  retry is bounded to one same-account retry and one alternate. Exhaustion is
  explicit and never invokes a paid OpenAI API-key route.
- **Protocol / limitations:** OpenAI Responses with streaming, tools, and
  discovered reasoning efforts. Official client catalog/profile compatibility
  is version-sensitive; setup and restore remain pending L06.
- **Evidence:** **L06 qualification Fail — `account-unavailable`**, RouteKit 0.8.0
  / `dad16c53` / 2026-07-22. The worker had no enrolled Codex account or
  Codex client, so live streaming, billing attribution, setup, and restore were
  not observed. Deterministic tools, reasoning, cancellation, failure
  propagation, and zero API-key fallback passed. [Stable L05 mapping; canonical import pending
  evidence](routekit-l06-evidence.md#route-codex-subscription).

<a id="route-claude-code-subscription"></a>

## Claude Code subscription

- **Credential / owner:** User-owned Claude Code OAuth credential enrolled
  with `accounts login claude-code` or imported with `accounts add`; stored
  under `~/.routekit/subscriptions/claude-code/`.
- **Billing / egress:** Uses the enrolled subscription OAuth credential, never
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, and relays directly to Anthropic. Anthropic determines
  plan usage and charges; exact attribution remains an L06 check. No
  third-party aggregator.
- **Quota / fallback:** Same-kind eligible-account rotation with bounded
  transient retry. Exhaustion is explicit and never invokes a paid Anthropic
  API-key route.
- **Protocol / limitations:** The native Anthropic Messages relay forwards the
  client's body. The OpenAI-compatible subscription backend inserts the Claude
  Code identity and rewrites other caller `system` and `developer` messages as
  `user` messages. Streaming, tools, and thinking are supported. Managed
  install/uninstall, exact settings restore, last-account removal, and
  interruption recovery passed the credential-free
  [ENG-682 qualification](routekit-claude-recovery-evidence.md).
- **Evidence:** **L06 qualification Fail — `account-unavailable`**, RouteKit 0.8.0
  / `dad16c53` / 2026-07-22. The worker had no enrolled Claude Code
  account or Claude client, so live streaming, billing attribution, and
  real-account/provider-session setup and restore were not observed. The
  credential-free managed lifecycle passed separately at `4e5a45b9`.
  Deterministic tools, reasoning, cancellation, failure propagation, and zero
  API-key fallback passed. [Stable L05 mapping; canonical import pending
  evidence](routekit-l06-evidence.md#route-claude-code-subscription).

## Cursor IDE custom OpenAI endpoint

- **Credential / owner:** Logged-in Cursor desktop account plus a local gateway
  token; model egress separately uses the selected RouteKit route's credential.
- **Billing / egress:** Expected boundary: custom-endpoint model calls use the
  selected RouteKit route's billing mode, while Cursor-owned services remain
  separate; exact attribution remains an L06 check. Agent requests use the
  local bridge and selected provider. Composer, inline edit, apply,
  autocomplete, authentication, and other Cursor-owned features can contact
  Cursor cloud.
- **Quota / fallback:** Adds no fallback; the selected provider route's rules
  apply. Cursor-cloud errors are not handed off to another RouteKit provider.
- **Protocol / limitations:** Custom OpenAI endpoint for Agent chat/plan.
  Streaming and tools are supported; images and reasoning controls are
  degraded. Other editor features do not use the custom model. Restore remains
  version-specific.
- **Evidence:** **L06 qualification Fail — `manual-evidence-unavailable`**,
  RouteKit 0.8.0 / `dad16c53` / 2026-07-22. This Linux worker had no Cursor
  desktop and could not run Cursorkit's macOS-oriented IDE launcher. No
  authenticated traffic, billing attribution, setup, or restore was observed.
  [Stable L05 mapping; canonical import pending
  evidence](routekit-l06-evidence.md#route-cursor-ide).

<a id="route-cursor-agent"></a>

## `cursor-agent` custom OpenAI endpoint

- **Credential / owner:** Logged-in `cursor-agent` account plus its local
  endpoint; model egress separately uses the selected RouteKit route's
  credential.
- **Billing / egress:** Expected boundary: endpoint model calls use the
  selected RouteKit route's billing mode, while Cursor-owned services remain
  separate; exact attribution remains an L06 check. Model calls use the local
  Cursorkit bridge; Cursor can still handle authentication, session, and
  product-service traffic.
- **Quota / fallback:** Adds no fallback; the selected provider route's rules
  apply. Cursor upstream errors are not silently expanded to a paid route.
- **Protocol / limitations:** Cursor bridge to OpenAI Chat. Streaming and tools
  are supported; images and reasoning controls are degraded. Session restore
  and compatibility are client-version-specific.
- **Evidence:** **L06 qualification Fail — `client-unavailable`**, RouteKit 0.8.0
  / `dad16c53` / 2026-07-22. `cursor-agent` was not installed, so no
  authenticated traffic, billing attribution, setup, or restore was observed.
  Deterministic bridge-protocol tools, reasoning, cancellation, failure
  propagation, and no RouteKit fallback passed. [Stable L05 mapping; canonical import pending
  evidence](routekit-l06-evidence.md#route-cursor-agent).

## Route explanation

`routekit models info <provider/model>` reports the live route's namespaced and
native model IDs, provider, account class, billing mode, default status,
capabilities, and reasoning metadata. API-key routes are classified as
`api-key` / `metered-api`; managed Codex and Claude Code routes as
`subscription` / `subscription`; and retained proxy routes as `proxy` /
`upstream-managed`. Unknown models fail and the response contract excludes
credentials, account labels, credential paths, and environment values.

The automated and zero-billed matrix evidence is recorded in
[RouteKit route explanation evidence](routekit-route-info-evidence.md).

## Qualification requirement

The deterministic harness is documented in
[RouteKit end-to-end verification matrix](routekit-e2e-matrix.md). The
[sanitized L06 report](evidence/routekit-real-account/2026-07-22-dad16c53.md)
maps every stable route anchor above to exact RouteKit revision, credential
mode, client/provider version, evidence date, protocol behavior, billing
attribution, failure behavior, and setup/restore results. Four rows are Fail,
so all public labels stay conditional.
The generated stable-map rows remain `pending` because this historical run
predates the mapping digest and case IDs; they do not override the immutable
ENG-679 report. A legacy importer must not fabricate modern case identities.
