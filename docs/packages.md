# Package guide

The TypeScript workspace is managed by pnpm. Package entry points are generally
`packages/<name>/src/index.ts`; tests live next to source under `src/test`.

This page is the short package guide. For full package ownership, exported
functions and classes, examples, and change guidance, read
[TypeScript reference](typescript-reference.md) and
[Python reference](python-reference.md). For schemas, generated bindings, and
HTTP contracts, read [Specs and APIs](specs-and-apis.md).

## Non-obvious directory to package mappings

Workspace directory names are implementation names, not always npm package
names. Use the manifest name when importing or installing:

| `packages/gateway` | `@velum-labs/routekit-gateway` |
| `packages/fusion-gateway` | `@fusionkit/gateway` |
| `packages/harness-core` | `@velum-labs/routekit-harness-core` (plus `@velum-labs/routekit-harness-core/testing`) |
| `packages/tools` | `@velum-labs/routekit-tools` |
